    "Time Complexity: Time Complexity is defined as the number of times a particular instruction set is executed rather than the total time taken. It is because the total time took also depends on some external factors like the compiler used, processor’s speed, etc.\n",

    "Space Complexity: Space Complexity is the total memory space required by the program for its execution.\n",

    "Both are calculated as the function of input size(n).\n",

    "One important thing here is that in spite of these parameters the efficiency of an algorithm also depends upon the nature and size of the input. \n",

    "\n",
    "    Best Time Complexity: Define the input for which algorithm takes less time or minimum time. In the best case calculate the lower bound of an algorithm. Example: In the linear search when search data is present at the first location of large data then the best case occurs.\n",
    "    Average Time Complexity: In the average case take all random inputs and calculate the computation time for all inputs.\n",
    "    And then we divide it by the total number of inputs.\n",
    "    Worst Time Complexity: Define the input for which algorithm takes a long time or maximum time. In the worst calculate the upper bound of an algorithm. Example: In the linear search when search data is present at the last location of large data then the worst case occurs.\n",

    "Algorithm analysis is the process of evaluating and understanding the performance characteristics of an algorithm. It involves analyzing factors such as time complexity, space complexity, and sometimes other metrics like stability, scalability, or correctness.\n",
    "Time complexity: Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. It helps us understand how the algorithm's performance scales with the input. Common time complexity notations include Big O notation (e.g., O(n), O(n^2), etc.), which provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm.\n",
    "Space complexity: Space complexity measures the amount of memory or space required by an algorithm to solve a problem as a function of the input size. It helps us understand how much memory the algorithm needs as the input size increases. Similar to time complexity, space complexity is also expressed using Big O notation.\n",
    "Other considerations: Apart from time and space complexity, other aspects like algorithm stability (preserving the relative order of equal elements), scalability (how well it performs as the input size increases), and correctness (whether the algorithm produces the correct result) are also important factors to consider during algorithm analysis.\n",
    "By analyzing these factors, we can compare and choose the most efficient algorithm for a given problem, optimize algorithms, predict performance bottlenecks, and make informed decisions regarding trade-offs between time and space complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that algorithm analysis provides theoretical insights into an algorithm's efficiency, but real-world performance can be influenced by various factors, such as hardware, programming language, compiler optimizations, and specific implementation details."
